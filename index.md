#Welcome to the Content First Prototyping Framework!

This is a bare bones version of the CFP Framework you can use to build your own content prototype up from scratch. This version includes:

- Global navigation and <head> includes
- Links to Zurb Foundation style and .js files
- Minimal monochrome wireframe style updates
- Starter index, category, and detail pages

If you're looking for something with a wider selection of patterns, pages, and templates, please download the [Content First Prototyping Starter Kit](https://github.com/andybywire/content-first-prototyping.git) instead.
