#Content First Prototyping Project Base
This is a bare bones project base for the Content First Prototyping framework. If you're looking for something with a wider selection of patterns, pages, and templates, please check out the [Content First Prototyping Starter Kit](https://github.com/andybywire/content-first-prototyping.git) instead.

##Dependancies

- [Command line tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (if youâ€™re on a Mac, this is probably already installed)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

##Installation

1. Install the Jekyll gem and Gulp (use `sudo` if you see permission errors)

        $ gem install jekyll

2. Clone/copy the Content first Prototyping Starter Kit to your project folder (this will take a minute or so)

        $ git clone https://github.com/andybywire/cfp-framework.git

    **- or -**

    Download and copy the [.zip](https://github.com/andybywire/cfp-framework/archive/master.zip) 

3. Navigate to your project file and install the framework dependencies

        $ cd <path to your project folder>

        $ npm install

4. Run `npm start`. Once installed, this is the only command you'll need to run to begin a new session. 

        $ npm start

##Documentation

In order to get the most out of the framework, it's worth familiarizing yourself with the basics of the tools it's built with. The documentation of all of these tools is excellent and should get you up to speed quickly:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
- [The Jekyll Data Pages Generator plugin](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/kitchen-sink.html)
- [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
